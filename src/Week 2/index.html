    <h2>
        Why Computer Science?
    </h2>
    <p>
        For as long as I can remember I have always been intrigued and fascinated by riddles, puzzles, mazes and locks.
        I've almost had an obsession over these things and understanding the inner workings of machines and utilities
        when they broke down. as I've grown up I have found more and more appreciation for game and puzzle design. and
        at first when I started taking CS classes I was really excited about the ability for me to have tools and
        problem solve by using those tools. I really enjoyed programming because it is a lot like a large puzzle that I
        can work out and reverse engineer so that I can have it achieve what I would like it to. I've become even more
        excited since I've started taking this class because of one of those hidden secret style of puzzle called an ARG
        (Alternate Reality Game). the reason for this is because oftentimes these ARGs take place across social media,
        websites with hidden elements, YouTube videos and many other sources. but because I have been currently working
        on one of these projects myself I look forward to being able to apply what I'm learning with this class directly
        to one of my hobbies.

    <h2>Outstanding acomplishments</h2>
    <p>
        - At the age of nine, I initiated and successfully led the effort to construct a sidewalk on Angel Street in
        Kaysville. Through fundraising such as can collections and working with udot to claim a substantial grant. The
        project was completed several years later allowing me an may others walk to school rather than take a bus.
    </p>
    <p> - When I was 14 I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of Americia program, an achievement that
        only about 6% of scouts achieve. Making me one of about 2 million from the 130 million scouts that have joined
        the program since 1912.
    </p>
    <p>
        - I have done Martial Arts since I was 10 years old and achieved the rank of 1st and 2nd degree black belt. I am
        also currently in training for testing for my 3rd degree. Additionally within the world of martial arts I opened
        our companies second location as well as later managing our companies 3rd location.
    </p>
    <p>
        - At 19 I served a mission for my church in Buenas Aires Argentina for 2 years, having saved for most of my life
        to acomplish that financially. Additionally I was able to become fluent in Castillian Spanish (castellano).
    </p>
    <h3>Schooling</h3>
    <p>- Graduated high school in 2018</p>
    <p>- Earned my Associates of Science in the spring of 2023</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        My hobbies are quite varied and unique, at least in my own opinion. I thoroughly enjoy the process of
        woodworking, and normally with that I am working on projects to create props or my personal favorite, puzzle
        boxes/trickboxes. Additionally I enjoy unicycling which was actually something that took me many many months to
        learn how to do, and weirdly enough I can't actually explain my fascination with that, I've been interested in
        unicycling for many years (that is not to say I'm very good at it though haha). I am also an Avid Reader I love
        Brandon sanderson's works but to be fair I really love storytelling and oftentimes fictional stories are the
        ones that capture my attention the most, which is probably why I also enjoy playing D&D with some of my close
        friends. I also love training in martial arts, being able to hone my body to a level of discipline that most
        others don't achieve is something that's exciting to me as I get to watch myself progress. It has also done many
        things for me in the life skills area of my life Which I am so grateful for because without martial arts I would
        still be a very shy and self-conscious individual.
