    <h1>CS2350: Client-side Web Development</h1>
    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML was originally created to share content, particularly among the scientific community to share research. Much of what it is used for today is very different but its base of displaying information is quite similar. HTML is interpreted by browsers and allows us to render information on a page. In essence HTML is a document of structured data that is displayed most often by a browser.</p>
    <h2>CSS3</h2>
    <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, was created to make web pages look better. Originally meant to separate how a page looked from its content, CSS now helps us design websites in many ways. It works alongside HTML and tells browsers how to style elements like text, colors, and layout. So, while HTML focuses on the structure of a webpage, CSS focuses on how it looks. </p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a coding language that makes websites do things. Originally, it was used for small tasks on web pages, but now it does much more. It lets developers create interactive features, like forms that change when you click them or animations that move on their own. So, while HTML and CSS make things look good, JavaScript makes them work.</p>
